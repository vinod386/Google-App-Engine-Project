Prime number generator
======================
URL: http://1-dot-cch3-1234.appspot.com

This is a prime number generator application.

The AppEngine webservices that I had used are:

   i)Google user management service
   ii)Memcache

1. Once you go to the given URL, it will provide you the hyperlink to the available servlets
2. Click on the PrimeNumGenerator servlet
3. Click on the SignIn link and sign in with your google credentials (Google user management service)
4. Enter a number and click Generate
5. As a response, you will be provided a greeting message, processing time, n th prime number and Sign out option
6. You can use the "Generate another prime" link and give the same number to check the difference in the processing times (Memcache)
